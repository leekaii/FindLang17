# FindLang17 - Language Detection Project
This project is my first AI endeavor, where I implemented a language detection model using a dataset and guidance from a YouTube tutorial. 
After which I tried to expand the project to identifying the language of a given text input using a logistic regression model, a SVC and a random forest classifier to predict the language and TfidfVectorizer to get the individual words.
The models exhibits an average 99.45 % accuracy in detection and locally run on StreamLit.

Project Overview
- Preprocessing of text data
- Training a language detection model
- Predicting the language of new text inputs

Following Languages can be predicted:
Arabic, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Italian, Kannada, Malayalam, Portugeese,
Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, and Turkish
