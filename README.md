# FindLang17 - Language Detection Project
This project is my first AI endeavor, where I implemented a language detection model using a dataset and guidance from a YouTube tutorial. The project involves identifying the language of a given text input and it is made using a logistic regression model to predict the language and TfidfVectorizer to get the individual words.
The model exhibits a 97.9 % accuracy in detection and locally run on StreamLit.

- Predicting the language of new text inputs

Following Languages can be predicted:
Arabic, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Italian, Kannada, Malayalam, Portugeese,
